            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I started learning how to write codes in 2020 and I have never regretted since.</p>
            <p>Time really flies whenever I am working on a coding project.</p>
            <p>The amount of time spent debugging and solving challenging problems is probably a little too much for my own good.</p>
            <p>However, it is extremely satisfying when I am able to find the bug that is causing the issue or when I am able to solve those challenging coding problems.</p>
            <p>Not to mention that smacking myself in the face when I realise I misspelled a variable is a good way to wake up.</p>
            <p>I hope that someday I can be an outstanding Software Engineer and work for an amazing organisation for a meaningful cause!</p>
